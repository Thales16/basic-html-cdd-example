🛠 Local Setup Instructions

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/GustaORios/inventory-procurement-spa.git
cd inventory-procurement-spa


Install dependencies

npm install


Run the development server

npm run dev


Run the mock API (JSON Server)

npm run server


This serves API data from db.json.
Once the backend is built, the frontend will switch to the live API.
